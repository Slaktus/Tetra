# Tetra
### An opinion on how to make games in Unity
---
### Overview
Tetra is a framework that abstracts away a lot of Unity's rather opinionated coding style and replaces it with _my_ rather opinionated coding style. It also features stand-alone components that can be used outside the rest of the framework. It provides simple, allocation-free solutions for common problems in something approaching idiomatic modern C#.

In short, the goal of Tetra is to no longer have to write `using UnityEngine;` at the top of your classes.
